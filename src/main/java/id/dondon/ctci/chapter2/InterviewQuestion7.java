/**
 * Intersection
 * Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.
 * Return the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value.
 * That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list,
 * then they are intersecting.
 *
 * Example of Intersecting linked list :
 * 3 → 1 → 5 → 9 ➘
 *                7 → 2 → 1
 *         4 → 6 ➚
 *
 * Example of Non-Intersecting linked list :
 * 3 → 1 → 5 → 9 → 7 → 2 → 1
 *         4 → 6 → 7 → 2 → 1
